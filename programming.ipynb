    "-   This lecture reviews some Python programming essentials. Not exciting, but necessary for many students. \n",
    "-   There are many programming paradigms, but in data science, we typically use the *procedural programming* approach: We write a *script* file, containing a sequence of instructions, which we pass to an interpreter, which carries them out in real time as we iterate.\n",
    "    -   Imagine writing a \"script\" for a play: You name the characters (objects), you give them lines and tell them what to do (expressions, functions), and the director makes it all happen (control structures, interpreter)\n",
    "-   By contrast, for example, in *object oriented programming*, you design an abstraction of an object that a user will interact with through a variety of methods: For example, one object in Excel is a spreadsheet, and the programming revolves around how the user interacts with spreadsheets."

    "- When you have an ordered object, like a string or tuple or list, you can easily make selections from it by indexing\n",
    "- Here we run into a bit of an issue: Python starts *indexing* elements in ordered collections from 0, not 1\n",
    "- *Indexing is not counting* (in Python, C, etc., versus languages that index from 1, like R, FORTRAN, MATLAB, etc.)\n",
    "- This means that the \"first\" element in a tuple corresponds to index number 0, the \"second\" element corresponds to index number 1, and so on. \n",
    "- You can think of selecting the n-th element from `x` by typing `x[n-1]`, but at this point you have to make the psychological shift to thinking of `x[0]` as the first element and thinking directly of `x[n]` as the $n-1$-st element of `x` "

    "- Instead of thinking just about hardware/software and run time, if you take developer time and suffering into account, Python becomes an efficient language in big picture terms\n",
    "- It is undeniable, however, that Python does not compare favorably to languages like C/C++ or Rust in terms of speed\n",
    "- Python is not an \"efficient\" language for at least a few reasons:\n",
    "    1. It is interpreted, so all of the code is compiled (converted from human-readable to machine-readable) as the IPython interpreter reads your work line by line. This replicates lots of work and isn't globally optimized, slowing everything down.\n",
    "    2. Python has a Global Interpreter Lock, so only one set of instructions (thread) can be processed at a time. This makes it hard to take advantage of your multiple CPU cores and GPU(s).\n",
    "    3. The packages you're using are often not that efficient themselves: Unless they're calling compiled C, FORTRAN, or Rust code for use with Python, the above problems get compounded (e.g. Pandas is built on NumPy, Polars is an API to Rust code)\n",
    "- Python fans will say, \"There are ways to address these shortcomings!\" Yeah, ok, but I only have so many hours in my life\n",
    "- If there are problems, this is how you escalate:\n",
    "    1. Substitute vectorization and `map` when possible rather than using for loops. Passing arguments as vectors to, for example, NumPy will vastly speed things up \n",
    "    2. Use packages that call efficient code written in low-level languages (e.g. Pandas is build on Numpy, but Polars is built in Rust).\n",
    "    3. Use Numba's just-in-time compilation tools to convert your interpreted Python code to compiled Python code.\n",
    "    4. Use multiprocessing/multithreading. In Python, these packages are kind of a hassle.\n",
    "    5. Write the slow code in C/C++ or FORTRAN or Rust, and call it from Python. These languages don't have the GIL and aren't interpreted, so doing this solves most of your problems."

    "## Understanding Python\n",
    "- The secret to Python is that most of its counter-intuitive features are trying to avoid a performance bottleneck, introduced by the choice to make it an interpreted language that only ones one thread at a time. For example, \n",
    "    - In `for i in range(K)`, the `range()` function is an iterator: It doesn't actually make a list of numbers from 0 to K-1. Instead of using a `return` statement, it uses a Python-ism, `yield`. The actual list of numbers from 0 to K-1 is never constructed, it just spits out the next number in the list when needed. This is efficient in terms of memory, but can be awkward to code with.\n",
    "    - In the Python `multiprocessing` package, to get around the GIL, the package essentially launches more instances of the IPython interpreter and divides the work among those instances using `pickle` to pass objects back and forth. \n",
